# GenZ Gmail extension

Yassify your emails! Go slay, girlll!  
Most email sign-offs are boring. Here's an extension to fix that for you.

Representing genz, I must ask you kindly to rather be creative and think of some cool sign-offs yourself, but in case you're having a no bones day, this is a quick fix!

## Build

> Developer only section

```bash
npm run build # creates a dist directory
# you need to build the project (and the dist directory) to install the extension
```

## TODO:

- Make the "Yassify" button rainbow colored
- Store a `name` field so the sign-off is ready to go
- Ability to choose a random sign-off and also hand pick it
- Ability to add your own sign-offs
- (possibly but unlikely) publish sign-offs to a central shared public database, so users can share ideas

## Future ideas:

To help with the yassification of emails, the extension can also add a rainbow border to the email content.  
Other ideas include - rephrasing vulgar words, linking to tiktok sounds, etc.  
// Depends on how many people download it, if it's even worth spending the time
